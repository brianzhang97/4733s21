your code:

function z=first_test(x,y)
% z=first_test(x,y)
% This is just to set up and test the homework workflow.
% Add a line of code below that will compute matrix z as matrix x times matrix y.

 z = x*y; 
% To get the credit, this function needs to work and return the correct value.
% Do not change the name of the file or the function line in any way, it would not run.
% You may want to write another function to test this function.
end
