your code:

function z=first_test(x,y)
% z=first_test(x,y)
% This is just to set up and test the homework workflow.
% Add a line of code below that will compute matrix z as matrix x times matrix y.


% To get the credit, this function needs to work and return the correct value.
% Do not change the name of the file or the function line in any way, it would not run.
% You may want to write another function to test this function.
end
 
test input:
x =
   -0.6490   -0.7585   -0.8456
    1.1812   -1.1096   -0.5727
y =
   -0.5587    0.5864
    0.1784   -0.8519
   -0.1969    0.8003
 
trying to run z=first_test(x,y)
Output argument "z" (and maybe others) not assigned during call to "first_test".
